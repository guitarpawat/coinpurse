# CoinPurse

CoinPurse simulate monetary objects and Purse by using inheritance and polymorphism.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism can be used when one task perform in different ways in many class. Sometimes, it like a draft for the classes.

## Inheritance

You can use methods and variables from superclass in subclasses if it is not private and can override if it is not final.

## Abstract class

Abstract classes is like an interface but you can write some codes to use it in subclasses without writing the same code in each class again.

## Observer

Purse class has extends Observable, so you can create any class to receive the event when it's fire. You can create and add the observer to the Main class.
